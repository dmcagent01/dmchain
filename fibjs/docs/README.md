## Translation Purpose
To broadcast fibjs and reduce learning cost of developer whose first-language is not chinese, we need to provide English document.

## Translation Pattern
Just read comments in `*.idl` and `*.dox` files in `src` directory, then TRANSLATE them.

## Translation Steps
1. Comment to claim file(s) you want to translate
2. fork this project
3. finish translation then take one PULL REQUEST to this project.
4. wait proofing/reviewing by others, after checked/corrected, changes would be merged to this project.

## Documentation Generation
run `doxygen` at directory `src`.
